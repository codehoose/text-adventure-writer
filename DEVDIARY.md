# 2018-07-31 Day 1
_Time Spent: 2.5hrs_
Thought I'd start the adventure writer project. I was going to do a video about it, but there would be too much uhms and errs. Instead I'll plough on and develop it behind the scenes and then present it when I have things to show.

Tonight I did a first pass at the lexer, such that it is and the parser (such that _it_ is) with a dummy test program. The lexer, parser and dictionary interact with each other and so far I have directions working. So that's a good start. Off to bed now.
